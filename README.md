# cx-ccx
T optimization of galois field circuits by commuting cx and ccx.

Feynman (https://github.com/meamy/feynman) has verified all the circuits.

The file verified.log contains final t-count and other statistics.

# This folder contains 3 kinds of files:

1. the one with extension .log (except verified.log) is the proof output by "feynver".

2. the one with _i is the input circuit in .qc format.

3. the one with _o is the output circuit of cx-ccx.

Also, the pair of _i and _o file is the input of feynver.
